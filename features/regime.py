"""
features/regime.py — Detect market regimes using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM).

WHAT IS A MARKET REGIME?
  Markets don't behave the same way all the time. They cycle through distinct
  states:
    0 - Bull / low vol   : trending up, momentum strategies work
    1 - Bear / high vol  : trending down, fear dominates, correlations spike
    2 - Sideways         : no clear trend, range-bound choppy action
    3 - Crisis / extreme : black swan events, everything breaks down

WHY THIS MATTERS FOR PREDICTION:
  The same feature (e.g. RSI=70) means something completely different in a
  bull market vs a crisis. By labeling each day with its regime, we give the
  model critical context. The meta-learner in Phase 4 will also use regime
  to dynamically weight which model to trust more.

HOW HMM WORKS (simple version):
  We observe daily returns + volatility. The HMM says: "given these
  observations, what's the most likely hidden state (regime) the market
  was in?" It learns the transitions between states from historical data.
  Think of it like weather forecasting — you can't directly observe "summer"
  or "winter", but temperature + humidity patterns tell you which season it is.

WE FIT ON NIFTY INDEX (not individual stocks):
  Market regime is a macro concept. We use the Nifty 50 index returns and
  volatility to label regimes, then broadcast that label to all 50 stocks.
  Every stock on the same day gets the same regime label.
